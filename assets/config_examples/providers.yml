# A "provider" is a service that provides access to a filesystem.
#
# A full configuration for every provider implemented in the application.
# You can find full breakdowns for each provider's configuration in it's respective file under
# `assets/config_examples/`.
#
# Schema is as follows:
# Provider Name: string - used to identify which filesystem to access.
#   provider: string - should be one of the built-in providers.
#   path: string - optional, just used for `disk` right now.
#   config: mapping - used for provider-specific configuration values, such as authentication.
